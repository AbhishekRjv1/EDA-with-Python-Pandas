# EDA-with-Python-Pandas

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in data analysis, involving understanding the data, discovering patterns, and extracting meaningful insights. This repository provides examples and demonstrations of EDA techniques using Python's Pandas library. The included Python script performs an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing medical appointment information, covering data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to gain insights into the factors influencing patient no-shows.

## Prerequisites

- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Data:** Ensure the 'Data.csv' file is in the same directory as your script for successful execution.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib:** For creating visualizations.
- **seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.

## Data Overview

The dataset is loaded from the 'Data.csv' file and initially explored. Key actions performed on the dataset include:

- **Data Loading:** Loading data into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Cleaning:** Modifying columns, changing data types, and creating new columns for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzing patterns, distributions, and relationships in the data.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations to understand the data better.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:**
    - Converted date and time columns into standard format.
    - Created 'weekday' columns for both ScheduledDay and AppointmentDay.
    - Renamed columns for consistency.
    - Dropped unnecessary columns.

2. **Missing Data Analysis:**
    - Checked for missing values (no missing data found).
    - Provided guidelines for handling missing data if present.

3. **Data Exploration:**
    - Explored unique values and their counts for each column.
    - Visualized the count of variables in relation to the 'NoShow' column.

4. **Data Transformation:**
    - Created age groups and converted them into categorical variables.
    - Converted categorical variables into dummy variables for modeling.

5. **Correlation Analysis:**
    - Examined correlations between predictors and the target variable ('NoShow').
    - Visualized the correlation matrix.

6. **Bivariate Analysis:**
    - Conducted in-depth analysis based on gender, age group, and medical conditions (e.g., Hypertension) to understand their impact on no-show appointments.

## How to Use

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Run the script, and it will provide detailed insights and visualizations about the dataset. Adjust visualizations and analysis as needed for your specific use case.
